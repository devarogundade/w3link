# W3link

W3Link functions as an interoperability framework with the objective of establishing a seamless connection between the PEGO Network and various other blockchain networks. It leverages a decentralized network of intermediaries called the W3Link Node (WLN) to enable secure and effective cross-chain transactions. As a security measure, the WLN incorporates a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, mandating validators to lock up $W3L tokens as collateral for validating relayed transactions.
